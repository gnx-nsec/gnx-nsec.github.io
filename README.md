# GNX-NSEC

**GNX** is the official Linux User Group of Netaji Subhash Engineering College - revamped from original Nixal. It inherits the ideals and principles of Nixal and has been launched to raise awareness about the importance of Open Source and enthusiasm for Linux among the Peer Students of Netaji Subhash Engineering College.

GNX stands for **GNX**'s **N**ot ni**X**al - a play on GNU abbreviation of GNU's Not Unix. The name has been selected as such to always remind us that while we work and remain in service of the students and all enthusiasts, GNX and its members should never succumb to inactivity like its predecessor. 

GNX was conceptualized in 2018 as just a group of Linux and Open-Source enthusiasts wanting to revive Nixal once more. However, a new rechristened LUG was not the only thing that came into being. With the blessings of Original Founding Member of Faculty of Nixal, GNX was formally formed in 2019 under banner of Department of CSE, Netaji Subhash Engineering College, Kolkata - 152.
